\section{Executive Summary}
This document is the fourth in a series of milestone documents that will accompany the planning of the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator}. The Emulator project is an application that will allow developers of Sifteo applications to test the features of Sifteo Cubes --- miniature computers that interact and communicate when used in tandem --- in a virtual programming environment. There is currently an emulator from Sifteo, Inc. that comes as part of the \gls{SDK}\index{SDK}\glsadd{SDKa} for the Cubes. However, Singularity intends to come up with a more natural interface than the one currently provided in that application.\\\\
This milestone defines the standards for code in the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator} project as well as the manner in which change will be controlled. It also elaborates the test cases that sufficiently cover the system. Future milestones will present design and usability reports as the software stabilizes.

\section{Introduction}
Developers of applications for the \gls{Sifteo Cubes}\index{Sifteo} currently must test programs they create for the platform within the emulator provided by Sifteo. While this emulator covers all  the functionality of the Sifteo Cubes, it presents a user interface that Singularity Software believes could be more naturally implemented. As such, Singularity Software will provide, in the form of the Siftables Emulator\index{emulator}, a new software-based emulator\index{emulator} for the Sifteo Cubes that will allow developers to more naturally interact with the platform.\\\\
Milestone 4 relies on previous milestones as it defines a change control plan, coding standards, and test cases. It follows Milestones 2 and 3, which laid the foundation and elaborated the requirements of the Siftables Emulator specification based on the high-level design created in Milestone 1. Milestone 5 will elaborate on the upcoming \gls{usability study} comparing the proposed Siftables Emulator design to the Sifteo\index{Sifteo} emulator's design before presenting original and feedback-based interface designs for the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator}.

\section{Project Background}
The Siftables Emulator is being developed by Singularity Software as part of the Junior Project sequence of classes at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. When projects were solicited for the sequence, clients Tim Ekl and Eric Stokes (both Rose-Hulman alumni) submitted a request for an emulator\index{emulator} for Sifteo Cubes, a new platform intended for ``intelligent play." After Singularity was chosen for the project, we met with Mr. Ekl to determine the three primary features of the Emulator: a Workspace where 1-6 Cubes could mimic the manipulations possible with physical Cubes, an \gls{API} to program those virtual Cubes, and a set of example games designed to show off the first two features. Singularity's Emulator\index{emulator} is intended to build on the foundation of Sifteo, Inc.'s existing emulator by creating a more fluid and natural user interface.
