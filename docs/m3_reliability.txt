As a system that emulates another system and runs user-created code, it is important that the Siftables Emulator does not contribute defects of its own to the application testing process. As such, Singularity Software will aim for a defect rate of 5 bugs/KLOC. As a predictor of this result, we will evaluate the cyclomatic complexity of our code at each development milestone, aiming for a score of 15 or less [cite: http://gdub.wordpress.com/2006/07/09/cyclomatic-complexity-for-python-code/]. The final measure of the emulator's reliability will be the accuracy of the virtual screen renderings; it will attempt to produce renderings that are 98% accurate. In numbers, this means that up to 327 of each Cube's 16384 (128x128) pixels may be rendered inaccurately or not at all.
