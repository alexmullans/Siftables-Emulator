\section{Executive Summary}
This document summarizes the problem addressed by the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator} project. After providing a brief summary of the clients---Tim Ekl and Eric Stokes---and the current solution, or lack thereof, it goes on to provide more detail about the stakeholders involved in the project and their primary concerns and needs. Those stakeholders include the clients and the developers of \index{Sifteo}Sifteo Cube programs, who will be the primary users of the software. Finally, an overview of the proposed product and its key requirements and features, as agreed upon by the client and Singularity Software, is detailed, and the constraints surrounding the project's development are enumerated. Future documents will use the information contained herein as a starting point from which to provide more details of the final solution.

\section{Introduction}
Developers of applications for the \gls{Sifteo Cubes}\index{Sifteo} currently must test programs they create for the platform on the Cubes themselves.  With a full release of the Cubes and corresponding \gls{API}\index{API}\glsadd{APIg} still pending, developers unable to join the Sifteo Early Access program are left without a software-based interface within which to productively develop Sifteo programs. As such, Singularity Software will provide, in the form of the Siftables Emulator, a software-based emulator\index{emulator} for the Sifteo Cubes that will allow any developer to try programming in the unqiue environment provided by the Cubes.\\\\
This document is the first in a series of milestone documents that will accompany the planning of the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator}. It will provide an overview of the current system, all involved clients and stakeholders, and a statement of the problem Singularity seeks to solve. Additionally, it will detail a list of high-level features as agreed upon with the clients. Future milestones will delve into the user cases, data flow diagrams, and prototypes necessary to convert those high-level features to a working system; as the project progresses, future milestones will also present plans for change control, coding standardization, and testing. Finally, design and usability reports will make up the core of milestones near the end of the quarter as the software stabilizes.
