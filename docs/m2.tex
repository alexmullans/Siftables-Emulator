\section{Executive Summary}
This document is the second in a series of milestone documents that will accompany the planning of the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator}. The Emulator project is a first of its kind application that will allow developers of Sifteo applications to test the features of the Cubes in a virtual programming environment. Currently, the only way to test apps developed for the Sifteo Cubes platform is with the physical Cubes; this project will eliminate that need and serve as a demo for the possibilities of the Sifteo platform.\\\\
This milestone elaborates the functional features of the the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator} project. It first gives a brief background of the project before moving on to elaborate features with use cases and declarative statements, where appropriate. It also maps all covered use cases to their relevant features. Finally, it presents mockups of the Emulator's design for consideration and to solicit client feedback.  Future milestones will present plans for change control, coding standardization, and testing. Finally, design and usability reports will make up the core of milestones near the end of the quarter as the software stabilizes.


\section{Introduction}
Developers of applications for the \gls{Sifteo Cubes}\index{Sifteo} currently must test programs they create for the platform on the Cubes themselves.  With a full release of the Cubes and corresponding \gls{API}\index{API}\glsadd{APIg} still pending, developers unable to join the Sifteo Early Access program are left without a software-based interface within which to productively develop Sifteo programs. As such, Singularity Software will provide, in the form of the Siftables Emulator\index{emulator}, a software-based emulator\index{emulator} for the Sifteo Cubes that will allow any developer to try programming in the unqiue environment provided by the Cubes.\\\\
Milestone 2 lays the foundation of the Siftables Emulator specification based on the requirements gathered in Milestone 1. It will be supplemented by the specification and prototypes in Milestone 3. Milestone 4 will rely on these early milestones as they define a change control plan and test cases, and Milestone 5 will elaborate the usability guidelines and interface design that implement the features and use cases described herein.


\section{Project Background}
The Siftables Emulator is being developed by Singularity Software as part of the Junior Project sequence of classes at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. When projects were solicited for the sequence, clients Tim Ekl and Eric Stokes (both Rose-Hulman alumni) submitted a request for an emulator for Sifteo Cubes, a new platform intended for ``intelligent play." After Singularity was chosen for the project, we met with Mr. Ekl to determine the three primary features of the Emulator: a Workspace where 1-6 Cubes could mimic the manipulations possible with physical Cubes, an \gls{API} to program those virtual Cubes, and a set of example games designed to show off the first two features. Singularity's Emulator will be the first program of its kind on the market for Sifteo Cubes. \\

A full feature listing and description can be found in Appendix A.

\section{Work/Data Flow Diagrams}
The following pages contain work/data flow diagrams that elucidate the passage of control and data through the emulator. As there is not much pure data that flows through the emulator system aside from the user's program, Singularity Software has elected to combine the workflow and data flow diagrams.
