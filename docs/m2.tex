\section{Executive Summary}
This document elaborates the functional features of the the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator} project. It first gives a brief background of the project before moving on to elaborate features with use cases and declarative statements, where appropriate. It also maps all covered use cases to their relevant features. Finally, it presents mockups of the Emulator's design for consideration and to solicit client feedback. Future documents will reference use cases presented in this document as features are progressively implemented, tested, and delivered.

\section{Introduction}
Developers of applications for the \gls{Sifteo Cubes}\index{Sifteo} currently must test programs they create for the platform on the Cubes themselves.  With a full release of the Cubes and corresponding \gls{API}\index{API}\glsadd{APIg} still pending, developers unable to join the Sifteo Early Access program are left without a software-based interface within which to productively develop Sifteo programs. As such, Singularity Software will provide, in the form of the Siftables Emulator, a software-based emulator\index{emulator} for the Sifteo Cubes that will allow any developer to try programming in the unqiue environment provided by the Cubes.\\\\
This document is the second in a series of milestone documents that will accompany the planning of the Siftables\index{Siftables} Emulator\index{emulator}. It provides coverage of functional features via uses cases and declarative statements before presenting initial design mockups. Future milestones will present plans for change control, coding standardization, and testing. Finally, design and usability reports will make up the core of milestones near the end of the quarter as the software stabilizes.

\section{Project Background}
The Siftables Emulator is being developed by Singularity Software as part of the Junior Project sequence of classes at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. When projects were solicited for the sequence, clients Tim Ekl and Eric Stokes (both Rose-Hulman alumni) submitted a request for an emulator for Sifteo Cubes, a new platform intended for \"intelligent play.\" After Singularity was chosen for the project, we met with Mr. Ekl to determine the three primary features of the Emulator: a Workspace where 1-6 cubes could mimic the manipulations possible with physical Cubes, an API to program those virtual cubes, and a set of example games designed to show off the first two features. Singularity's Emulator will be the first program of its kind on the market for Sifteo Cubes.
